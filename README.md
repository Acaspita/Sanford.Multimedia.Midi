Sanford.Multimedia.Midi
=======================

This is all source code of the C# MIDI toolkit from CodeProject by Leslie Sanford. We made it 64bit and windows 8 compatible and removed the need of additional assemblies.

So far I was able to find the sources of the referenced assemblies and I've added them as sources into the project to reduce the amout of .dll files floating around.

If you have any improvement or fix to this library, please don't hesitate to make a fork and open a pull request.
